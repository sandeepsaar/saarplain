 Ammonium ferric citrate has the formula (NH4)5[Fe(C6H4O7)2]. A distinguishing feature of this compound is that it is very soluble in water.A mixture of indefinite composition that contains ferric and ammonium cations and citrate(3−) anions, ferric ammonium citrate may be obtained as red crystals or a brownish yellow powder or as green crystals or powder. It is added to foods as an acidity regulator and anticaking agent. It is also used as a positive oral contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging, and was formerly administered orally as a source of iron for the treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia.<br>
Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9.Folic acid is indicated for the treatment of megaloblastic anaemia because of the folic acid deficiency. It is also used for prophylaxis in chronic haemolytic states, in renal dialysis, and in drug induced folate deficiency.Folic acid is used for the prevention of recurrence of neural tube defects.<br>
Folic acid is a vitamin which we use to prevent or treat a deficiency of folic acid in the body. Folic Acid 5mg Tablets is  used in the treatment and prevention of certain types of anaemia a low red blood cells. Adequate amounts of vitamin B12  need to be given along with folic acid. Folic acid Tablets can also be given to some women before and during pregnancy to prevent spina bifida  an abnormality of the spine in babies, which can be caused by deficiency of this vitamin.<br>
Vitamin B12 is the common name for a nutrient known scientifically as cyanocobalamin. It's used as a dietary supplement and to treat certain anemias . It is involved specifically in the normal metabolism of folate and the consequent maintenance of normal homocysteine serum levels.It has been used as a supplement in patients who is having the deficiency of vitamin B12 and in those with diabetes and other neuropathies. Use in dementia is advocated, aside from correcting deficiencies.<br>
The tablet occurs naturally and in  pure form of Vitamin B12. It is taken to regulate certain vital bodily functions like cell multiplication, blood formation, and protein synthesis. This drug is used to treat Vitamin B12 deficiency in people with Pernicious Anemia.<br>
Vitamin B12  also helps the body to make red blood cells.If someone is having low levels of vitamin B12, that person may feel weak, have less energy, and experience slow thinking  , it is a condition called pernicious anemia.

     <p><b>Ferric Ammonium Citrate</b> contains between 16.5% and 18.5% of iron. It exerts haematinic action by being an essential constituent of haemoglobin. It is necessary for the oxidative process of living tissues. Absorption: Ferric is converted into Ferrous form and it is absorbed in ferrous form. <br>

<b>Folic acid,</b> as it is biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. 
Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.
 <br>
<b>Cyanocobalamin </b>For many years, the B12 group of vitamins had been used to treat pain. Vitamin B12 was categorised as an analgesic drug. It was suggested that vitamin B12 may increase availability and effectiveness of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the descending inhibitory nociceptive system . MeCbl exerted therapeutic effects on neuropathic pain in diabetics. But the analgesic mechanisms of MeCbl remained elusive till now. <br>
It works by functioning in the production of a compound called myelin, which covers and protect nerve fibers. It rejuvenates the damaged neuron.

<b>Ammonium ferric citrate:</b>
As a reducing agent of metal salts of low activity like gold and silver. With potassium ferricyanide as part of the cyanotype photographic process. Used in Kligler iron deeps to determine hydrogen sulfide production in microbial metabolism. In medical imaging, ammonium ferric citrate is used as a contrast medium.<br>
<b>Folic acid:</b> 
Pharmacodynamics of folic acid is as follows ,the mucosa of the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum are rich in dihydrofolate reductase, where folates and folic acid are absorbed. Once it is  absorbed, folic acid is rapidly reduced  and then methylated to form tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives which are rapidly transported to the tissues.<br>
 <b>Cyanocobalamin:</b>
As a coenzyme of methionine synthetase, methylcobalamin  plays an important role in transmethylation in the synthesis of methionine.it  is well transported to nerve cell organelles, and promotes nucleic acid and protein synthesis. Experiments with cells from the brain origin and spinal nerve cells in rats shows that  it is involved in the synthesis of thymidine from deoxyuridine.it also restores end-plate potential induction early by increasing nerve fiber excitability in the crushed sciatic nerve in rats.

  <p><b>Ammonium ferric citrate:</b><br>
The absorption and endogenous excretion of iron in man was studied by monitoring the fecal excretion of a stable iron isotope . The study was carried out for 12 healthy volunteers who were divided into two groups.As a result, the 58Fe absorption ratio in group II was statistically significantly higher than that of group I (34.4 +/- 6.1% vs. 15.0 +/- 5.5%, M +/- SD). The similar absorption ratio (34.1 +/- 6.0% vs. 14.8 +/- 5.5%) was also obtained by our new formula. Our results confirmed the previous findings that the availability of iron is stimulated by the supplementation of vitamin C. Both formulae agreed in the absorption of iron, indicating that the endogenous excretion of iron (caused by the desquamated cells) in the intestine does not disguise the iron absorption.<br>
<b>Folic acid:</b> <br>
<b>Absorption:</b> Folic acid is absorbed rapidly from the small intestine and primarily absorbed from the proximal portion. Naturally occurring folates are reduced enzymatically to folic acid in the gastrointestinal tract prior to absorption. Folic acid appears in the plasma approximately 15 to 30 minutes after an oral dose; peak levels are generally reached within 1 hour.<br>
<b>Distribution:</b> Tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives are distributed to all body tissues but  primarily stored in the liver. 
Metabolism: Folic acid is metabolized in the liver into the cofactors dihydrofolate DHF and tetrahydrofolate THF , by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).<br>
<b>Elimination:</b> After a single oral dose of 100 mcg of folic acid in a limited number of normal adults, only a trace amount of the drug appeared in the urine. Approximately 50% of the dose appearing in the urine. After intake of single oral dose of 15 mg, up to 90% of the dose was recovered in the urine. A majority of the metabolic products appeared in the urine after 6 hours; excretion was generally completes within 24 hours. Small amounts of orally administered folic acid have also been recovered in the feces. In lactating mothers folic acid is also excreted in the milk .<br>
<b>Vitamin B12:</b><br>
<b>(1) Absorption:</b> the substance of Vitamin B12  bind to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, and are then absorbed from the gastrointestinal  tract. Gastrointestinal tract  absorption can also occur by passive diffusion 
 Single-dose administration When it was administered orally to healthy adult male volunteers at single doses of 120 µg and 1,500 µg during fasting, the peak serum total vitamin B12 concentration  reached after 3 hrs for both doses, and this was dose-dependent. 
There was a gradual increase which peaked at about 2.8 times the initial value at the 12th week of dosing. <br>

<b>(2) Distribution:</b> Vitamin B12 is bound to specific plasma proteins called transcobalamins. Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver.  It diffuses across the placenta and appears in breast milk also.<br>

 <b>(3) Excretion:</b> Vitamin B12 is excreted in the bile, and undergoes enterohepatic  recycling , some part of a dose is excreted in the urine, most of the dose in the first 8 hours . 40-80% of the amount of total B12 excreted in the urine by 24 hrs after single-dose administration is excreted within the first 8 hrs.<br>

 <b>(4) Elimination:</b> Half-life 12.5 hrs
