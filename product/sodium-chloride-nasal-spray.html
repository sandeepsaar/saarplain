                <p><b>Sodium chloride</b>, also known as salt, common salt, table salt or halite, is an ionic compound
                    with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions. Sodium
                    chloride is the primary salt in seawater and in the extracellular fluid of many multicellular
                    organisms.<br />
                    <b>Benzalkonium chloride</b>, also known alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride , is a type of
                    cationic surfactant. It is an organic salt classified as a quaternary ammonium compound. It has
                    three main categories of use: as a biocide, a cationic surfactant, and as a phase transfer
                    agent.<br />
                    Benzalkonium is a quaternary ammonium compound used as a biocide, a cationic surfactant, and as a
                    phase transfer agent . It is more commonly contained in consumer products in its salt form,
                    benzalkonium chloride . This salt is used in a great variety of international pharmaceutical
                    products such as eye, ear, and nasal drops or sprays as an excipient ingredient serving as an
                    antimicrobial preservative ,it is an active antimicrobial agent

                <p>Sodium chloride â€” major electrolytes of the fluid compartment outside of cells (i.e., extracellular)
                    â€” work together to control extracellular volume and blood pressure. Disturbances in sodium
                    concentrations in the extracellular fluid are associated with disorders of water balance.
                    Benzalkonium chloride: not entirely elucidated, the bactericidal action of benzalkonium chloride is
                    believed to be due to the disruption of intermolecular interactions. Such disruption can cause the
                    dissociation of cellular membrane lipid bilayers of bacteria, resulting in compromised cellular
                    permeability control and the leakage of important cellular contents, a variety of critical
                    intermolecular interactions and tertiary structures in very highly specific biochemical systems that
                    allow bacterial agents to function normally can be readily disrupted or deactivated by cationic
                    surfactants like benzalkonium.

                <p><b>Sodium chloride</b>:Sodium the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the
                    control of water distribution, fluid balance, and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also
                    associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body
                    fluid. Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and
                    changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Benzalkonium chloride</b>:Benzalkonium chloride solutions are generally categorized as biocidal
                    agents with relative long durations of action. Their spectrum of activity has been demonstrated
                    against bacteria, to some viruses, fungi, and protozoa , although bacterial spores are treated as
                    being resistant to the agent. Finally, solutions of benzalkonium chloride are bacteriostatic or
                    bactericidal based on their concentration. Bacteriostatic agents act to prevent further growth of
                    bacterial organisms that are present while bactericidal agents function to kill bacteria that are
                    present . In general, the activity of the agent is not largely affected by pH, but such activity
                    does increase substantially at higher temperatures and prolonged exposure times.

                <p><b>Sodium chloride:</b><br />
                    <b>Absorption</b>: of sodium in the small intestine plays an important role in the absorption of
                    chloride, amino acids, glucose, and water. Chloride, in the form of hydrochloric acid (HCl), is also
                    an important component of gastric juice, which aids the digestion and absorption of many nutrients.
                    The volume of distribution is 0.64 L/kg
                    <br /><b>Elimination</b>: Substantially excreted by the kidneys.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Benzalkonium chloride:</b><br />
                    <b>Absorption</b>: benzalkonium chloride absorption was evaluated in women using tampons containing
                    the agent. Venous blood samples were drawn 15 minutes before the tampon application and then again
                    at 15 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 24 h after application. Benzalkonium chloride was not detected in any of
                    the blood samples at any time tested. the excipients will only ever be present at the minimal levels
                    necessary to maintain the integrity of the product substance.<br />
                    <b>Metabolism</b>:benzalkonium chloride is structurally a large, positively charged molecule it is
                    likely poorly absorbed and eliminated largely in faeces, similar to other quaternary ammonium
                    compounds<br />
                    <b>Elimination</b>: Administered benzalkonium chloride is likely eliminated largely in faeces,
                    similar to other quaternary ammonium compounds

                    <li><span class="dot"></span>Gently blow your nose to clear out any mucus, making it easier for the

                    <li><span class="dot"></span>You can lie down on a bed with your head hanging slightly over the edge
                        or tilt your head back if you're sitting or standing. For certain conditions, tilting your head
