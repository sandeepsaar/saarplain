Papain, L-lysine HCl, Niacinamide, Thiamine monocitrate and Pyridoxine HCl is used to boost digestion and people who do not get nutrients like vitamins, amino acids from their diets. It may be used for treating parasitic worms, promotes normal growth and development by increasing collagen formation. It also prevents chronic diarrhea and ulcerative colitis.<br></p>

     <p>
     Common digestive problems include heart burn, GERD, IBD and IBS. Symptoms may include diarrhea, gas, acidity and constipation which leads to abnormal digestion. Hence supplementation with digestive enzymes is used to treat a number of digestive conditions like Malabsorption, lactose tolerance and celiac disease. Multivitamins and amino acids provide adequate nutrition and play a major role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, digestive and bone disorders. Supplementation with digestive enzymes and multivitamins can prevent a number of diseases and provides various nutrients in our diet.

     <p><b>DIGESTIVE ENZYMES</b><br><br>

Our body produces millions of enzymes every second. In essence, our enzymes cause the natural essential chemical reactions our bodies require to live. A huge number of biological functions are to varying degrees controlled by enzymes.<br>

Digestive enzymes are one way the body breaks down food to provide cells with the energy and nutrients they require, including the essential vitamins we need daily. Our combination contains a specific selection of digestive enzymes normally found within the body to assist in the efficient digestion of protein, carbohydrate and fats. It also contains plant derived enzymes like papain.<br><br>

<b>PAPAIN</b><br><br>
Papain is one of the many powerful digestive enzymes that nature has given to human beings. <br>

Commonly found and extracted from the papaya fruit (Carica papaya). It is also referred to as papaya proteinase. The papaya-enzyme papain plays a key role in digestive processes involving breaking down tough protein fibers.<br><br>

<b>Mechanism of Action:</b><br>

The papaya-enzyme papain is able to break down larger proteins into smaller proteins or peptides or even into the smallest amino-acid subunit by cleaving the bonds in the interior of the protein chain or the end of the chain (endopeptidase and exopeptidase activity, respectively) in a broad pH range.This gives it a marked ability to enhance the total digestive 
process and increase the nutrient absorption of protein-based foods. Its ability to hydrolyse (break down) proteins also means that it can play a key role in many normal physiological processes and potentially influence disease processes for the good.<br><br>


<b>AMINO ACIDS</b><br><br>

Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, and are found in many food sources. Some amino acids can be made by your body, but others, known as the "essential amino acids," must be obtained through food or supplements.<br><br>

<b>L-Lysine:</b>

L-lysine is an amino acid (a building block of protein) that is essential for health. However, it cannot be manufactured naturally in the human body like other types of amino acids.
Therefore, L-lysine, also called lysine, is considered as one of the eight essential amino acids.
In order to obtain lysine, one has to eat foods high in its content or take dietary supplements containing it. As a building block for protein, amino acids like L-lysine are necessary for normal growth and development. In particular, L-lysine is needed by the body to manufacture carnitine, a substance that is used in the conversion of fatty acids into energy. It also helps in calcium absorption and collagen formation which are important for muscle and bone health.<br>

Foods that are high in L-lysine include high protein foods like nuts, red meat, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, and sardines.<br><br>

<b>VITAMINS</b><br><br>

Vitamins are nutrients we must get from food. A well-balanced healthy diet provides most of the nutrients we need each day, but even the best eating plans can fall short of meeting all of the 40-plus nutrients we need on a daily basis. It is important to keep in mind that supplements are intended to enhance, not take the place of a healthy diet. The best strategy is 
to eat at least three meals a day and choose nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products. To fill in any nutritional gaps in your diet, a basic multi-vitamin, selected for our age and sex, is the smartest approach.<br><br>

<b>Niacinamide:</b>

Niacin and niacinamide are forms of Vitamin B3. Vitamin B3 is found in many foods including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, beans, and cereal grains. Niacin and niacinamide are also found in many vitamin B complex supplements with other B vitamins.<br><br>

<b>Thiamine Mononitrate:</b>

Thiamine is a vitamin, also called vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is found in many foods including yeast, cereal grains, beans, nuts, and meat. It is often used in combination with other B vitamins, and found in many vitamin B complex products. Thiamine is also used for digestive problems including poor appetite, ulcerative colitis, and ongoing diarrhea.<br><br>

<b>Pyridoxine HCL:</b>

Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is part of the B group vitamins and is water soluble and is required for both mental and physical health. It plays an important role in protein, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.<br><br>

<b>Mechanism of Action:</b><br>

Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), B6 (Pyridoxine) & Niacinamide. These vitamins play essential role as co-enzyme for the metabolism of nervous system. Thus this combination normalizes the nerve cell metabolism. This combination supports the regeneration of nerve fibers and myelin sheath by activation of the metabolism and the natural repair mechanism. The combination of these 3 vitamins shows better efficacy than that of the individual components. In addition, Vitamin B1, B6 & niacinamide promote body's own repair mechanism and work in pain management.

           <p> With multivitamins, very rarely hypersensitive reaction and sensitivity disturbance may occur. The severe or irreversible adverse effects of papain, which give rise to further complication, include angioedema. The symptomatic adverse reactions produced by papain are more or less tolerable and if they become severe, they can be treated symptomatically, these include hypersensitivity, hypernatremia, arthritis. GI adverse reactions, such as 
diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, have been reported with lysine ingestion.

           <p>Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) reduces therapeutic effect of levodopa but it does not occur if a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor is also given. Neomycin, chloramphenicol, aminosalisylic acid & histamine H2 receptor may reduce Vitamin B12 absorption. No data regarding the interactions of papain is found. Concomitant use of calcium supplements with lysine may be associated with increased absorption and reduced elimination of calcium. Aminoglycoside 
toxicity may be enhanced in patients taking lysine supplementation.</p>

           <p>This combination (Vitamin B1+B6+Niacinamide) should be avoided in case of hypersensitivity to thiamine, cobalt or any other component of these ingredients. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking lysine if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Taking papain by mouth during pregnancy is possibly unsafe. There is a concern that it might cause birth defects or 

miscarriage. Not enough is known about the safety of using papain during breast-feeding. 

Don't use it if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. There is a concern that papain might 

increase the risk of bleeding in people with a clotting disorder.</p>

            B complex multivitamins should not be used in patients on levodopa therapy. Papain should be contraindicated in pregnancy and in conditions like hypersensitivity to the drug. Lysine supplementation is contraindicated in patients with hyperlysinemia/hyperlysinuria. Patients with hepatic and renal impairment should avoid supplementation with lysine. If use is warranted, patients should consult a health care provider.
